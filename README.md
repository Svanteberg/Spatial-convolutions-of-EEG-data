# One-dimensional spatial convolutions of EEG data

## Introduction

EEG data are usually presented visually as two-dimensional data, one spatial and one temporal dimension. The recording skalp electrodes measures the cortical electrical field from positions in a three-dimensional space, roughly corresponding to a half sphere. Presenting the data with one spatial dimension results in spatial discontinuities. This logically results in disruption of spatial invariant features, possibly making analysis by convolutions harder.

There are 21! ways of ordering the electrodes of a 21 electrode montage, making it hard to explore and find the optimal order. Finding orders were neighboring electrodes in three dimensions are placed as close as possible in one dimension may result in better results when using convolutions. Transforming by taking the electrodes columnwise, using the same direction in the column, results in some neighboring electrodes being parted and a filter of size 3 will miss a feature involving the electrodes:

However, changing the direction between columns make the same electrodes one-dimensional neighbors:

Below is an example of just using the order in which the channels are stored automatically by the recording system, resulting in large discontinuities:

## Method

To test the hypothesis that the order of the electrodes affects the results when using convolutional networks, a simple data set was created. Eight spatial features was defined as:

</p>

Data was generated by summing a field of random values with a feature, also having some random variation in amplitude:

</p>

As a measure of discontinuity, the Chebyshev distance was used. A discontinuity was defined as when for two one-dimensional neighbors

in the two-dimensional grid approximation. The minimum filter size to cover the unit circle in all cases is calculated
